Files to check
--------------

To understand how this dashboard works have a look at the following files:

* config.ru
* dashboards/sample.erb
* jobs/icinga.rb
* widget/simplemon/\*
* widget/table/\*
* assets/stylesheets/icinga.scss

Quick Start for this Dashboard
------------------------------

Make sure you have Ruby and the Tool "gem" installed on your system.

```
apt-get install ruby rubygems bundler
# on newer Debian or Ubuntu systems
# rubygems has been moved into the ruby package
```

The next command will use the ruby bundler to install all gem dependencies.

```
bundle
```

Tip: to install dashing in your user context use:

```
bundle install --path ~/.gem

# but you need to add the bin dir to your path
for bin in `echo .gem/ruby/*/bin`; do
  PATH="$HOME/$bin:$PATH"
done
```

```
dashing start
```

Now go to http://localhost:3030/
